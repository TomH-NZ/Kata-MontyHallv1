##PseudoCode for Automation steps.

- Number of times to run entered into system
- Game is generated
- Player selection is fed into game
- System determines announcers door
- Player swaps doors / does not swap doors
- Results are recorded in a list, 1 for serious, 0 for joke
- Steps repeated until max run time reached.

This would be run from a separate class/file so that each method is called.  Will be able to feed 
the correct values for player selection and changing door directly into the method, skipping
the validation entirely.
Have two files, one for swapping player door and one for not swapping player door.
